# 🃏 DeckChain - Decentralized Smart Deck Manager

## 📖 Overview
**DeckChain** is a decentralized smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to **create**, **shuffle**, and **draw** digital cards from decks securely on-chain.

This project demonstrates how blockchain can be used to manage card-based games or collectible systems transparently without relying on centralized servers.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🧩 **Create Cards:** Define cards with names and metadata (JSON/IPFS).
- 🃏 **Create Decks:** Group existing cards into custom decks.
- 🔀 **Shuffle Decks:** Randomly shuffle decks using pseudo-random logic (`keccak256`).
- 🪄 **Draw Cards:** Draw cards one by one from the top of the deck.
- 🔒 **Ownership:** Only the deck creator can shuffle or draw from it.
- 👀 **Transparency:** All deck data and actions are stored on-chain.
